# ðŸŽµ AI Dynamic Layering Guide

## What is Dynamic Layering?
AI Dynamic Layering is an intelligent system that analyzes your current musical arrangement (beats, melodies, lyrics) and automatically generates complementary instrumental parts to enhance your composition.

## How It Works

### 1. **Getting to Dynamic Layering**
- Go to the Studio page
- Click on **"Dynamic Layering"** in the sidebar (look for the layers icon)

### 2. **What You Need First**
Before using Dynamic Layering, you should have some existing music elements:
- **Beat Pattern**: Create some drums in Beat Maker
- **Melody**: Add some notes in Melody Composer
- **Lyrics** (optional): Can help AI understand the style
- **Code Music** (optional): Generated from Code Translator

### 3. **Using Dynamic Layering**

#### Step 1: Choose Your Style
Select from these musical styles:
- **Electronic**: Synth layers, electronic instruments
- **Orchestral**: Strings, brass, woodwinds
- **Jazz**: Piano, saxophone, upright bass
- **Rock**: Electric guitars, bass, keyboards
- **Ambient**: Atmospheric pads, textures
- **World**: Global instruments and scales
- **Cinematic**: Epic, film-score style layers
- **Experimental**: Unique, creative combinations

#### Step 2: Set Complexity
Use the slider to control how complex the AI layers should be:
- **1-3**: Simple, minimal layers
- **4-6**: Moderate complexity with some variations
- **7-10**: Complex, intricate arrangements

#### Step 3: Generate Layers
- Click **"Generate Layers"** button
- AI analyzes your current arrangement
- Generates complementary instrumental parts
- Each layer includes:
  - **Instrument type** (piano, strings, bass, etc.)
  - **Musical notes** with timing and pitch
  - **Volume and panning** settings
  - **Effects** (reverb, delay, etc.)
  - **Role** (harmony, melody, rhythm, etc.)

### 4. **Working with Generated Layers**

#### Playing Layers
- **Play Individual Layer**: Click the play button on any layer card
- **Play All Layers**: Click "Play All Layers" to hear everything together
- **Stop**: Click stop or wait for playback to finish

#### Layer Information
Each generated layer shows:
- **Instrument**: What instrument it uses
- **Type**: Lead, harmony, bass, percussion, etc.
- **Volume**: How loud it plays (0-100%)
- **Pan**: Left/Right stereo positioning
- **Notes**: How many musical notes it contains
- **Role**: Its function in the arrangement
- **Effects**: Applied audio effects

### 5. **Integration with Other Tools**

The generated layers work with:
- **Master Mixer**: Control overall mix
- **Song Uploader**: Can be combined with uploaded songs
- **AI Assistant**: Get suggestions about the layers

### 6. **Tips for Best Results**

1. **Start with a foundation**: Create a basic beat and melody first
2. **Choose appropriate style**: Match the style to your existing music
3. **Experiment with complexity**: Try different complexity levels
4. **Layer incrementally**: Generate a few layers, listen, then add more
5. **Mix and match**: Use different styles for variety

### 7. **Example Workflow**

1. Create a drum pattern in Beat Maker
2. Add a simple melody in Melody Composer
3. Go to Dynamic Layering
4. Choose "Electronic" style, complexity 5
5. Generate layers
6. Listen to individual layers
7. Play all together
8. Adjust in Master Mixer if needed

### 8. **Common Use Cases**

- **Enhance sparse arrangements**: Add fullness to simple beats
- **Create backing tracks**: Generate accompaniment for melodies
- **Experiment with styles**: Try different genres on same base
- **Fill frequency gaps**: Add bass, mid, or high-frequency content
- **Create variations**: Generate multiple versions of arrangements

## Troubleshooting

- **No layers generated**: Make sure you have some existing music elements first
- **Layers don't sound good**: Try different complexity or style settings
- **Can't hear layers**: Check your Master Volume and track volumes
- **AI taking too long**: The AI needs a moment to analyze and create layers

The Dynamic Layering system uses advanced AI to understand musical theory, harmony, and arrangement principles to create professional-quality instrumental parts that complement your existing music!
