# Overview

CodedSwitch is the world's first AI-powered bidirectional translation platform that bridges code development with music creation. It provides revolutionary circular translation where code generates music that can translate back to identical source code. The platform offers an integrated development environment for translating code between programming languages, generating musical compositions from code structures, converting music back to functional code, creating beats and melodies, scanning code for security vulnerabilities, writing lyrics, and intelligently layering instruments. The platform combines a React frontend with an Express.js backend, featuring multi-layered audio synthesis, comprehensive AI integrations, dynamic instrument layering, and breakthrough Music-to-Code conversion capabilities.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side uses React 18 with TypeScript, following a component-based architecture. Vite is used for builds, and state management is handled via React hooks, context, and TanStack Query for server state. The UI is built with shadcn/ui and Radix UI primitives, styled with Tailwind CSS in a custom dark theme. The Web Audio API powers the custom AudioEngine for synthesis and playback, with Wouter handling client-side routing.

## Backend Architecture
The server is a RESTful API built with Express.js and TypeScript, separating concerns into service layers for OpenAI, audio processing, and data storage. It includes middleware for logging, error handling, and JSON parsing. An interface-based storage layer (IStorage) abstracts database operations for various project entities.

## Database Design
PostgreSQL is used with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations. The schema includes tables for users, projects, code translations, beat patterns, melodies, vulnerability scans, and lyrics, utilizing UUID primary keys and foreign key relationships. The database is configured for Neon Database, with Drizzle Kit for migrations.

<h2>AI Integration Architecture</h2>
OpenAI's GPT-4o model is integrated for features like code translation, beat generation, melody composition, security scanning, lyric generation, and intelligent assistance. All AI interactions are server-side, with the backend proxying requests to OpenAI.

<h2>Audio Processing Pipeline</h2>
The audio engine features advanced multi-layered synthesis for realistic instrument and drum sounds. Drum sounds use multiple oscillators and noise layers with natural decay. Guitar synthesis includes harmonics, attack transients, and body resonance. The system supports real-time playback with live pattern editing, visual timing indicators, mixer functionality, and transport controls.

<h2>Development Workflow</h2>
The application supports development and production modes, utilizing Vite for the client and esbuild for the server.
