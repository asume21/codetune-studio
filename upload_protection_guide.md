# GitHub Upload Protection Guide

## Corruption Prevention Strategy

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
The file corruption was caused by:
- Double base64 encoding during GitHub API uploads
- Lack of content validation before upload
- Missing round-trip integrity checks
- No verification of uploaded content

### 2. Safe Upload System Implementation

#### Key Features:
- **Pre-upload validation**: JSON syntax checking, code structure validation
- **Corruption detection**: Scans for base64 patterns in source code
- **Safe encoding**: UTF-8 to base64 with round-trip verification
- **Post-upload verification**: Downloads and validates uploaded content
- **Retry logic**: Exponential backoff for network issues
- **Atomic operations**: All-or-nothing batch uploads

#### Critical Files Protection:
```javascript
const CRITICAL_FILES = [
  'package.json',      // Build dependencies
  'tsconfig.json',     // TypeScript configuration
  'vite.config.ts',    // Build system configuration
  'tailwind.config.ts', // Styling configuration
  'drizzle.config.ts', // Database configuration
  'postcss.config.js', // CSS processing
  'components.json'    // UI component registry
];
```

### 3. Usage Guidelines

#### Safe Upload Process:
1. **Validate locally**: Check file syntax and structure
2. **Clean encoding**: Ensure UTF-8 → base64 → UTF-8 integrity
3. **Upload with verification**: Send and immediately verify
4. **Rollback on failure**: Restore from backup if corruption detected

#### Example Usage:
```javascript
import SafeGitHubUploader from './safe_github_upload.js';

const uploader = new SafeGitHubUploader();
await uploader.safeUpload('package.json', content, 'Update dependencies');
```

### 4. Corruption Detection Patterns
The system detects corruption by checking for:
- Base64 encoded strings in source files (`aW1wb3J0`, `ZXhwb3J0`)
- Invalid JSON syntax in .json files
- Missing import/export statements in .ts/.js files

### 5. Future Prevention Measures

#### Automated Checks:
- Pre-commit hooks for file validation
- Continuous integrity monitoring
- Automated corruption recovery

#### Best Practices:
- Always use the SafeGitHubUploader for critical files
- Run integrity checks after any GitHub API operations
- Keep local backups of all configuration files
- Validate deployments work before considering uploads successful

### 6. Recovery Procedures

If corruption is detected:
1. Stop all deployment processes
2. Run comprehensive integrity check
3. Restore corrupted files from clean local versions
4. Verify all fixes before deployment
5. Update upload procedures to prevent recurrence

This system ensures that CodedSwitch deployments remain stable and corruption-free.
